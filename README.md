## 📦 What is Axion?

**Axion** is a fully modular, open-source multitool designed for Windows.  
It combines a wide range of utilities into one sleek command-line toolkit - from system automation to cybersecurity tools, developer helpers, and more.

Unlike other tools that claim to be for "educational purposes" and then drop sketchy stuff inside, Axion is built clean from the ground up - no junk, no malware, no BS.
